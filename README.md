# Startup Viability with Venture Capital Deep Learning Program 

This application was written to explore the the sklearn, keras Sequential deep learning algorithm. This program was written to create a deep learning model that can predict if an applicant company will or will not be successful upon receiving funding. The provided data set contains more than 34,000 applicants to be analyzed. An initial deep learning model was established and various different parameters were adjusted to create 2 additional, optimized models.
